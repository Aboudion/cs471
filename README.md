INITIAL IDEAS

I'm still working on my pres

but some things i see off the top of my head

Disk Objects

Folder Objects which can contain more folder objects or files

Files objects

file*

keep it OOP and simple to deal with

with a manager overtop of the whole structure

acting as the VFS

Disks, which contain files, folders and common file

Files, which contain collections of Folders and Files

which could hold anothe level of files due to it containing folders

copied out of chat. I aint even mad.
